SEARCH page functionality needs to be created
Trying to setup a third party API parts search, can't get it to work (I don't understand the API documentation for the sandbox version of Autoparts API from Motor.com).

AUTH Login needs to be created
I don't know how to do this. Recommendations on what I should review to do it right? Really struggled with understanding sessions. Setting up passport local, using sessions, creating a find user function that searches the DB for a registered user or creates a new one.

-endpoints
-Passport
-Find users

Join needs to display on ME (Home button), should show a list of users from the DB and their orders from the DB.

DB questions:
1 - can I place all table creation in the seed file, or do they each need their own sql file?

Function/Method questions:

How can I have my update parts method work with redux? 

wiz 2 - need to add image display box underneath input box.
