SEARCH page functionality needs to be created
logged in USER needs to be able to search parts by name OR by number, and return all orders...?

Join needs to display on ME (Home button), should show a list of users from the DB and their orders from the DB.

Function/Method questions:

How can I have my update parts method work with redux? 

wiz 2 - need to add image DISPLAY box underneath INPUT box.

wiz 3 - need to fix box sizing of description area

What do I want to show in the join list? User id of purchaser, order number, part numbers of purchase - I want to join the orders table to the parts table and the users table?? :|

remove "user" from HEADER

CREATE TABLE orders
